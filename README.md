  ## Description 
  
  *What, why, and how:* 
  
  We all know how big social networking has gotten and how big of a role it plays in many aspects from our daily lives to our work lives. As a full-stack web developer, I wanted to become better associated with the workings of these platforms. This is a back end project for a social network site. It has no front end. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database so that it can handle large amounts of unstructured data, and the Mongoose ODM.
